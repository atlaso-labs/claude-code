"""SessionStart notice: if this device is LOCAL-ONLY, tell the user — once.

Prints a Claude Code SessionStart hook result with a ``systemMessage`` (a banner
the USER sees in the terminal — NOT injected into the model's context) when the
device is running local-only. Shown at most once per distinct local-only episode
(keyed by the state's ``since`` timestamp), so we never nag every session. A
cloud-linked device prints nothing. Fast + file-only (no network). Never breaks
the session — any error → silent exit 0.
