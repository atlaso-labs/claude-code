# Shared resolver for the Atlaso hooks. Sourced by each hook.
#
# Two modes, auto-detected:
#   BUILT/installed → a vendored `runtime/` dir sits next to hooks/ (built by
#     package.py). We run the bundled packages on the runtime's own venv, built
#     once from the shipped uv.lock by a detached
#     `uv sync --frozen`, so the plugin is fully self-contained — no repo, no dev venv.
#   DEV/in-repo     → no runtime/; fall back to the SDK venv + the platform
#     siblings (what our tests use).
#
# atlaso_fg / atlaso_bg / atlaso_capture (in _guard.sh) run a python module in whichever
# mode applies, under a hard deadline, and NEVER return a turn-breaking non-zero.
