# Shared resolver for the Atlaso hooks. Sourced by each hook.

# Two modes, auto-detected:
#   BUILT/installed → a vendored `runtime/` dir sits next to hooks/ (built by
#     package.py). We run the bundled packages on a uv-managed Python + deps
#     (`uv run`), so the plugin is fully self-contained — no repo, no dev venv.
#   DEV/in-repo     → no runtime/; fall back to the SDK venv + the platform
#     siblings (what our tests use).
#
# `atlaso_run <module>` runs a python module in whichever mode applies, forwarding
# stdin/stdout, and NEVER returns a turn-breaking non-zero (memory is best-effort).
