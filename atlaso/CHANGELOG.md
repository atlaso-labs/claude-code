All notable changes to the Atlaso Memory plugin.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **The memory tools work again on a fresh install.** The plugin asked for "the
  MCP library, version 1.27 or newer". A version 2 of that library was published
  on 28 July which moved things around, so any *new* install picked it up and the
  memory tools (`remember`, `recall`, `forget`, `recent`, `status`) failed to
  start. Automatic recall and capture were unaffected — they don't use that
  library — so memory kept working; only the tools you call on purpose were
  broken. The version is now pinned so this cannot happen again.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- **Memory recall no longer gives up too early on a busy machine.** Recall runs
  before your prompt is sent, and it was allowed only 15 seconds. That is plenty
  once it is warm (it normally takes about a second), but on a cold start — the
  first prompt after opening your editor, especially while your machine is busy —
  it could run out of time. When that happened the recall was discarded silently:
  no memory for that turn, and nothing to tell you why. The limit is now 30
  seconds, which clears a cold start with room to spare.

  The limit is deliberately kept, not removed: recall blocks your prompt while it
  runs, so an unbounded wait would turn a slow lookup into a frozen session.
