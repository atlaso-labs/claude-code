All notable changes to the Atlaso Memory plugin.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- **Memory recall no longer gives up too early on a busy machine.** Recall runs
  before your prompt is sent, and it was allowed only 15 seconds. That is plenty
  once it is warm (it normally takes about a second), but on a cold start — the
  first prompt after opening your editor, especially while your machine is busy —
  it could run out of time. When that happened the recall was discarded silently:
  no memory for that turn, and nothing to tell you why. The limit is now 30
  seconds, which clears a cold start with room to spare.

  The limit is deliberately kept, not removed: recall blocks your prompt while it
  runs, so an unbounded wait would turn a slow lookup into a frozen session.
